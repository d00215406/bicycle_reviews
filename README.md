## Buggy/Incomplete Features

- Delete manufacturers from the MySql database

This function does work but it you will find yourself needing to press the back button on your browser to where the Manufacturers
table is displayed as clicking the delete button will take you to a blank page, due to be patched in future updates.

- Edit manufacturer

This is not currently working the edit button has been implemented into the manufacturers table but it doesnt work at this current moment
,due to be patched in future updates.
